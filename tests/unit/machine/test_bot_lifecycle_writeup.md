## Test Quality Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Core Functionality** | 🟢 Excellent | All basic operations covered |
| **Error Handling** | 🟢 Excellent | Comprehensive failure scenarios |
| **Dynamic Configuration** | 🟢 Excellent | Good assignment updates |
| **Lifecycle Edge Cases** | 🟢 Excellent | Comprehensive edge case coverage |
| **Resource Management** | 🟢 Excellent | Memory and connection management |
| **Documentation** | 🟢 Excellent | Clear test names and docs |

## Conclusion
The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of the Bot lifecycle management system with 15 tests covering initialization, registration, heartbeat management, error handling, resource management, and complete lifecycle transitions. The addition of failure scenarios, memory management, and integration testing significantly improves the robustness of the test suite. Remaining gaps are primarily in advanced patterns like retry logic and high-load scenarios.
